## Linked List

Linked lists can be thought of from a high level perspective as being a series of nodes. Each node has at least a single pointer to the next node, and in the last nodeâ€™s case a null pointer representing that there are no more nodes in the linked list.

Singly linked list: a list where elements have only a reference to next element
Doubly linked list: a list where elements are linked to both next and previous elements
